# Coursework-Manager

This is a simple tool that helps students to manage their courses in one place.  There are several features including a scheduling tool, assignment manager, and a file manager. 

# Usage 

## Scheduling Tool

- With the scheduling tool, students can plan out their courses prior to registration or use it as a calendar to figure out what classes they have next.
- Courses can be added with the add course button, where the student would then fill out course details such as the course title, its meeting location, the days the class meets, and the times the class meet.

## Assignment Manager

- The assignment manager helps students view all of the assignments they have to complete in a single place and tells them how much time they have left to complete them.
- Sections for each class are automatically created when the student adds a course to the scheduling tool.
- There are tabs that allow students to make notes about the progress of an assignment, change the assignment's status, and modify the due date.

## File Manager

- Folders are automatically created for the student to manage their assignment files in one location.
- Course or assignment specific folders can be accessed from the assignment manager.
- To access the course folder, the student would hit the file button without selecting an assignment.  To access an assignment's folder, the student would click an assignment on the table before hitting the same file button.
